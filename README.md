# Low-Code-and-Security

## Audience
I had the opportunity to present to the Information Security Auditors of one of the largest international banks. Their role involves overseeing and auditing external penetration testing for the organization. These professionals play a crucial part in ensuring the bank's cybersecurity posture by rigorously assessing security controls and identifying potential vulnerabilities through external audits.
