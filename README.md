# Low-Code-and-Security

## Audience
I had the opportunity to present to the Information Security Auditors of one of the largest international banks. Their role involves overseeing and auditing external penetration testing for the organization. These professionals play a crucial part in ensuring the bank's cybersecurity posture by rigorously assessing security controls and identifying potential vulnerabilities through external audits.


## Purpose

In my presentation, I discussed the security challenges and considerations associated with the rise of low-code/no-code platforms, which are becoming increasingly popular among companies. As these platforms grow, it is important for Information Security Auditors to understand the unique risks they pose and how to effectively audit applications built using these technologies.

***Low-Code/No-Code Platform Adoption***

Low-code/no-code platforms are on the rise, with more companies adopting them to accelerate software development. This trend is expected to continue as these platforms offer an accessible way for businesses to create applications quickly, even without extensive coding expertise. Major organizations have already embraced these platforms, demonstrating their potential in modern software development.

***Loss of Application Visibility***

However, one of the key challenges with low-code/no-code platforms is the loss of visibility over the applicationâ€™s internal workings. This makes it essential to conduct a white-box penetration test at the outset to ensure that nothing is overlooked. Without such an assessment, critical security gaps may go undetected.

***Human Error and Manual Penetration Testing***

Applications built on low-code/no-code platforms are particularly susceptible to human error, which is often a major security weakness. These errors are harder to detect through automated audits, making it necessary to perform manual penetration testing. Human intervention is critical to identify vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.

***Challenges in Conducting Security Audits***

Security audits on low-code/no-code applications are more complex due to the lack of access to source code. Auditors must often rely on the platform provider for support, which adds another layer of complexity. It is crucial to choose a platform with a reliable and transparent provider to mitigate potential security risks.

***Special Framework for Audits***

There is a specific framework designed for security audits of low-code/no-code applications. To address the unique risks associated with these platforms, OWASP has created a specialized Top 10 list for low-code/no-code projects, distinct from the standard OWASP Top 10 for web applications.

***Key Risks in Low-Code/No-Code Applications***

The most significant risks in low-code/no-code applications include enumeration vulnerabilities, data leaks, and weaknesses in business logic. These risks require targeted testing and a thorough understanding of the platform's limitations to ensure comprehensive security coverage.

This presentation provided the Information Security Auditors with valuable insights into the unique challenges of auditing low-code/no-code platforms, helping them identify where to focus when requesting audits on such applications.
